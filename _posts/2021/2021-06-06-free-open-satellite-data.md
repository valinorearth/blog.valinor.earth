Many governments, independent organizations, and agencies have Satellite Data that is Open and Free for anyone to access, study, analyze, and experiment. There is too much data; one needs to focus and pick the ones suitable for specific purposes.

## Bhuvan

India has been launching satellites since 1998. The Satellite Data is available on the [Bhuvan Indian Geo-Platform](https://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/). Most of the data is India-specific. The information includes IMS-1 (Hyperspectral), Cartosat, OceanSat, and ResourceSat.

## Copernicus Open Access Hub

[Copernicus Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu), earlier known as a “Sentinels Scientific Data Hub,” provides the newest images from all Sentinels: Sentinel-1 radar imagery, optical multispectral imagery from Sentinel-2 as well as Sentinel-3 land products for environmental analysis together with atmosphere and air quality data in Sentinel-5P.

## DigitalGlobe

Though not all are free, DigitalGlobe gives you a good amount of 30-cm high-resolution satellite imagery. You can use their [DigitalGlobe Open Data Program](https://www.maxar.com/open-data) to access these imageries for relief — fires, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, and earthquakes.

## EOS LandViewer

[LandViewer](https://eos.com/landviewer) is part of EOS (Earth Observing System), one of the official distributors for high-resolution satellite images. LandViewer has CBERS-4, Sentinel-1, 2, MODIS aerial NAIP, Landsat-7, 8, and 4, 5 for historical photos. Among the datasets are SPOT 5-7, Pleiades-1, Kompsat-2, 3, 3A, SuperView-1. Some of the best spatial resolutions go as far as 40-cm per pixel.

## NASA’s Earth Data Search

Most of NASA’s Earth Data is an analysis product for the study of Earth Science -- such as the biosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, or atmosphere.

[NASA Earthdata](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search) has data on global land use and cover -- specialized satellite-derived data like permafrost and wetland types.

## NOAA: Data Access Viewer

NOAA's [Data Access Viewer](https://coast.noaa.gov/dataviewer/) has datasets mainly along the coasts. It holds satellite, aerial, and LiDAR imagery.

## Sentinel-Hub

[EO Browser](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/explore/eobrowser/) has multiple medium and low-res images. These include the complete collections from all Sentinel missions, Landsat 5, 6, 7, and 8, Envisat, Meris, MODIS, GIBS, and Proba-V.

[Sentinel Playground](https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-playground/) can be used for satellite imagery mosaic of Earth gained from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, DEM, and MODIS.

Download the ESA’s open-source [Sentinel-2 Toolbox](http://step.esa.int/main/download/). The toolboxes give you the framework to a rich set of analysis, visualization, and processing tools.

## UNAVCO

University NAVSTAR Consortium, [UNAVCO](https://www.unavco.org), provides satellite imagery for scientific research. UNAVCO provides access to geodesy data such as flooding, plate tectonics, and earthquakes. Their platform — [UNAVCO SAR Archive Search](https://www.unavco.org/data/sar/sar.html) provides Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Data.

## USGS Earth Explorer

USGS has one of the oldest collections of various free GIS data, accessible through their [EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). It offers 50 years' worth of comprehensive satellite imagery. All gathered from USGS-NASA and various NASA remote sensors. This is Terra and Aqua MODIS, ASTER, VIIRS, and many others. There are open datasets produced under collaboration with ISRO and ESA.
